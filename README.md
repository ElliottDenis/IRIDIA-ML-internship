# IRIDIA ML internship
 
Worked on different projects which can be found in the srource folder ("src"). These include some example code from the "Hands-on Machine Learning" book by Aurélien Géron, models to classify galaxies and find their redshifts using SDSS surveys, and some CNN using galaxy images from Dr Ben Henghes and Prof. Ofer Lahav from University College London.

The "data" file has SDSS data which was found on Kaggle and was exported as a csv file.

# IRIDIA ML internship
 
Worked on different projects which can be found in the srource folder ("src"). These include some example code from the "Hands-on Machine Learning" book by Aurélien Géron, models to classify galaxies and find their redshifts using SDSS surveys, and some CNN using galaxy images from Dr Ben Henghes and Prof. Ofer Lahav from University College London.

Note: The idea for the SDSS classifiers and regressors came from an article by Henghes et al.: https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/505/4/4847/6288434

The "data" file has SDSS data which was found on Kaggle and was exported as a csv file.

Extra research could include:
- Classifying galaxies by morphology/type: for example: https://paperswithcode.com/paper/rotation-invariant-convolutional-neural
- Study the superimposed part of the clustering space: maybe define a new category: active galaxies?
- Using the clustering, do outlier detection
- In the CNN, try skip connections (similar to ResNet)
- To help with galaxy classification: browse SOTA: https://paperswithcode.com/task/image-classification
- For general research, and finding new research ideas, use: https://www.connectedpapers.com/

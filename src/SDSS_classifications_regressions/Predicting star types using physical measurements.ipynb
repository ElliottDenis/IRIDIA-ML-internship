    "This is a dataset consisting of several features of stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of them are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Absolute Temperature (in K)\n",
    "- Relative Luminosity (L/Lo)\n",
    "- Relative Radius (R/Ro)\n",
    "- Absolute Magnitude (Mv)\n",
    "- Star Color (white,Red,Blue,Yellow,yellow-orange etc)\n",
    "- Spectral Class (O,B,A,F,G,K,,M)\n",
    "- Star Type **(Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence , SuperGiants, HyperGiants)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lo = 3.828 x 10^26 Watts (Avg Luminosity of Sun)\n",
    "Ro = 6.9551 x 10^8 m (Avg Radius of Sun)\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of making the dataset is to prove that the stars follows a certain graph in the celestial Space ,\n",
    "specifically called Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram or simply HR-Diagram\n",
    "so that we can classify stars by plotting its features based on that graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is created based on several equations in astrophysics. They are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stefan-Boltzmann's law of Black body radiation (To find the luminosity of a star)\n",
    "- Wienn's Displacement law (for finding surface temperature of a star using wavelength)\n",
    "- Absolute magnitude relation\n",
    "- Radius of a star using parallax .\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset took 3 weeks to collect for 240 stars which are mostly collected from web.\n",
    "The missing data were manually calculated using those equations of astrophysics given above."
